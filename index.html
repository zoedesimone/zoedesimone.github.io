<div class="intro-container"><h1c>I am pusuing a dual Masters in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering & Building Technology @ MIT, in Cambridge Massachussets, where I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow. I am working under Prof. Christoph Reinhart on Decision Making frameworks to help cities meet 2050 carbon emission reduction targets and increase clean energy adoption rates. 

I recently completed my bachelor's in Architecture at Cornell University, where I combined my passions for tool development and design and wrote my undergraduate thesis on integrating machine learning with particle simulation for building design. Most recently, I worked in the Applied Research and Development team at Foster + Partners in London, where I helped develop tools to improve design collaboration using AR/VR for the AEC industry. 
 
On the side, I’ve led research projects with the Environmental Systems Lab and Robotics Construction Lab at Cornell, where I was responsible for the full lifecycle of product development, including ideation, design, research, development, implementation and validation.

  <p>Generative text-to-image (GTI) models produce high-quality images from short textual descriptions and are widely used in academic and creative domains. However, GTI models frequently amplify biases from their training data, often producing prejudiced or stereotypical images. Yet, current bias mitigation strategies are limited and primarily focus on enforcing gender parity across occupations. To enhance GTI bias mitigation, we introduce DiffusionWorldViewer, a tool to analyze and manipulate GTI models' attitudes, values, stories, and expectations of the world that impact its generated images. Through an interactive interface deployed as a web-based GUI and Jupyter Notebook plugin, DiffusionWorldViewer categorizes existing demographics of GTI-generated images and provides interactive methods to align image demographics with user worldviews. In a study with 13 GTI users, we find that DiffusionWorldViewer allows users to represent their varied viewpoints about what GTI outputs are fair and, in doing so, challenges current notions of fairness that assume a universal worldview. </p>

  <p>As offices and buildings reopen during the covid pandemic, it is more important than ever that designers and policy makers have the right methods to analyze the safety of indoor spaces. In light of the problem, I developed a software tool, Indoor Eddy3D, to simulate the impact of architectural floor plan layouts and ventilation on indoor air quality and Sars-CoV-2 spread.
The tool allows for better decision making, informed by particle data, air movement and 3 dimensional space organization. The tool and workflow was developed with Patrick Kastner and Timur Dogan, and presented at the 2021 Building Simulation Conference.</p>
